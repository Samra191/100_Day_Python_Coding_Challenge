# 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge
Welcome to the 100 Days of Python Coding Challenge! This repository is dedicated to documenting progress in learning Python from scratch using resources like W3Schools.

## Challenge Overview
The challenge follows the 100 Days of Code format, with a commitment to coding in Python every day for 100 days. The focus is on mastering basic to intermediate Python concepts while working on hands-on projects.

## Learning Path
Starting with the fundamentals of Python, the journey progresses from syntax and loops to more advanced topics like file handling, modules, and web scraping.

## Key Concepts Covered:
Day 1-10: Python Basics (variables, data types, operators)

Day 11-20: Control Structures (if-else, loops)

Day 21-30: Functions and Scope

Day 31-40: Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries

Day 41-50: File Handling

Day 51-60: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Day 61-70: Modules and Packages

Day 71-80: Exception Handling

Day 81-90: Web Scraping and APIs

Day 91-100: Final Project and Review

## Repository Structure
The repository is updated daily with code snippets, explanations, and project files for each day's challenge.
